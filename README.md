## TDD: Pros and Cons
### Pros
In large scale enterprise applications, test driven development can be very advantageous as it provides a way to account for corner cases (especially ones that occur small percent of the time). Enforcing TDD encourages developers to follow good code formatting and practices. This is due to the fact that failing to follow good code practices can lead to an unnoticable bug to be caught by the unit tests. It also provides a way to ensure that ones pushed code does not mess with a peer's recent edits.

### Cons
The incorporation of tests can largely increase the complexity of the application. While tests may be worth the time of companies, small development teams will require to spend much more time on a test that they know will be passed (since there is a good chance they have wrote a decent amount of the code themselves). It is also inconvenient for small applications as it is more of a hassle than a quality of life improvement. Also, in small teams, it may be more worthwile having a peer review code changes rather than taking the time to think of and develop tests.
